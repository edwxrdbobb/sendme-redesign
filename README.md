# SendMe SL Redesign

This project is a complete redesign of the **SendMe SL** website. Originally, the website was built and managed using **Wix**, which is a no-code platform. While Wix is user-friendly, it comes with limitations, particularly when it comes to design flexibility and customization.

To address these constraints, I redesigned the website using **Next.js** for a modern, fast, and more responsive experience, paired with **Tailwind CSS** for efficient, clean, and customizable styling. The new design focuses on providing a seamless and enhanced user experience, improving both performance and aesthetics.

### Key Improvements:
- **Performance**: The new website loads faster, providing a better user experience.
- **Design Flexibility**: The custom design gives more creative control and removes the restrictions of a drag-and-drop builder.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: The site is now fully optimized for mobile devices, ensuring a smooth experience across all screen sizes.
- **Interactivity**: Enhanced interactivity through modern JavaScript frameworks, making the site more engaging.

Below are the screenshots showing the website before and after the redesign.
